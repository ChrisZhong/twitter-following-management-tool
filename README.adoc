This app is my attempt at learning more about the tools that are available:

- Spring Framework ({spring-framework})
- Spring Boot ({spring-boot})
- Spring Social ({spring-social})
- Spring Social Twitter ({spring-social-twitter})
- Gradle ({gradle})
- Travis CI ({travis-ci})
- Heroku ({heroku})

This repository started out from a fork of {fork-repository} ({spring-gs-accessing-twitter}). This is a great starting point for me to build a web application.

== What does it do?
:application-url: https://enigmatic-anchorage-9135.herokuapp.com/

This is a self-contained Spring Boot application that accesses profile data from a Twitter user and from people whom the user follows on Twitter (i.e., friends).

Currently, it just shows the most recent 20 friends of the user.

The application can be accessed at {application-url}.

=== Coming soon

The following features have yet to be implemented (in no particular order):

- Show the time since the last tweet of the user's friends
- Navigate through all friends of the user
- Remembering authorization given by a Twitter user

== What you'll need to build
:java-version: 1.8
:jdk: http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html[JDK {java-version}]
:spring-gs-register-twitter-app: https://spring.io/guides/gs/register-twitter-app/
:application-properties: src/main/resources/application.properties
:application-properties-url: https://github.com/ChrisZhong/twitter-following-management-tool/blob/master/{application-properties}[application.properties]

If you would like to build your this application, you will need the following:

- {jdk}
- Your own keys from Twitter (a guide can be {spring-gs-register-twitter-app})

Once both requirements are met, start by including the keys in the {application-properties-url} ({application-properties}) file.
